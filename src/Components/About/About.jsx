<span className="font-bold">The founder of MEC 7</span> 

Swalahuddin, who is a former serviceman, designed MEC 7
as he aimed to spread happiness by attaining healthy bodies 
and minds. He designed this exercise form by using the knowledge
that he gained while serving in the army. When he retired after 
serving in the army for two decades, Swalahuddin dreamed of guiding
his people to healthy habits and fitness regimes. He created history
when the people of his locality realised the significance of Swalahuddinâ€™s
dreams and supported him. The first MEC 7 session was conducted in 
July 2012 at the school ground in Thurakkal, Kondotty. Ten years later, 
he opened the second MEC 7 centre in July 2022. However, Swalahuddin 
was able to open 121 exercise centres within 2 years of opening the second
centre. These centres are not just places where people gather to work 
out, but they have turned into communities that help in fostering
interpersonal relationships.
